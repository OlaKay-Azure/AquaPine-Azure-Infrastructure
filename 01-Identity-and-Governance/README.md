## DOMAIN OVERVIEW

This domain establishes the **identity and governance foundation** for Aquapine Consult's Azure infrastructure. All subsequent domains depend on the identity architecture and governance policies implemented here.

**Business Context**: As a multi-site aquaculture operation (Ibadan farms + Lagos HQ) with 45 employees across 11 departments, Aquapine requires:
- Centralized identity management for users across locations
- Role-based access control to protect sensitive data (HR payroll, microbiology research)
- Policy enforcement for compliance and cost control
- Organizational resource structure for operational efficiency
